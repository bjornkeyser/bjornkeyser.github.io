    <title>Relearning Magnetoreception through Sensory Augmentation</title>
</head>

<body>
We can use sensory substitution to strengthen and potentially relearn magnetoreception.
    
    What is SS?
        We can learn to hear using our skin. More general we can replace a defect sense by artificially sending the same information through another sensory channel
            E.G vision -> hearing, hearing -> vibration, vestibular -> electro stimulations
            some research also in sensory expansion (seeing more frequencies than we can (Neil Harbisson))
            and also in sensory addition


            Why does this work?
                because brains are 1 trick pony; they learn how to find patterns in data, and readjust their networks accordingly
                in short, we are not hardwired like computers, we are livewired
                NEURONS THAT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER
                because we close the feedback loop, between motor output (rotating head) and sensor feedback (e.g. tactile vibrations)
                
                Does closing the feedback loop work?
                    that is how we learned our senses as babies
                    there is nothing specially visual about the stimuli coming from the eyes, or sound-like in stimuli from the ears; they all get translated to same neural language
                    we see with the brain, not with the eyes (alone) (more than half of the brain dedicated to vision)
                    e.g. we learn what the incoming stimuli from the sides of our head are, because it correlates with vibrating our vocal cords, with seeing people;s mouth move, with things falling and moving in the world
                    we learn how to use our eyes and see depth e.g. moving head left means visual imagery moves right, and we calibrate when we reach for things (by 4 to 8 months). distance becomes calibrated.
                    e.g. i had a deaf child in class, he could not speak
                    for NATIVE senses, it can retrain them, for ALIEN senses, it can be learned but dependent on device

                    An open feedback loop does not work!
                        TVSS bach-y-rita shows clear difference when people held the camera, vs when they did not!

                    Why is that how we learn to sense?
                        humans are more neuroplastic than other animals, which is why we need so many years as babies,
                        but our advantage is that we can adapt to any environment; we live everywhere
                        unlike a giraffe or an animal that is stuck to its niche
                        because PH model of evolution makes evolving sensory apparatus easier, because the neural pathways do not have to be reinvented every time
                        brains are - by generalization - capable of learning novel senses by uncovering patterns in incoming and outgoing data, and somehow construct perception out of that

                    How do we close the feedback loop?
                        motor output should affect the sensory input somehow, in real-time. and sensory input affects motor output
                        sensory input can come in anywhere, given that all brains see are electrochemical signals with no special
                        take example BRAINPORT for balance
                        normally motor output (rebalancing) gets little feedback (mostly visual)
                        now we give feedback that is lost in these patients:
                        head position 2 tongue electric stimulation

                            Why the tongue?
                            very sensitive and so not much energy needed
                            does not matter where really
                        subjects learn to balance within minutes
                        AND EVEN HAVE AN AFTER-EFFECT

                        Why did they experience an after-effect?
                            This does not happen in sensory addition, or expansion, because the artificial sense only works using the device
                            HOWEVER, in this case, the sensory substitution device served as TRAINING WHEELS for the real sense
                            IMPORTANTLY, the real sense (vestibular) was not completely lost; whispers of signal were still present
                            so SS can be used as a form of rehabilitation
                        
                
    Why did we unlearn?
        Perhaps electromagnetic noise from modern technology
        We don't know.
        But humans' increased neuroplasticity is a good reason why we also easily unlearn something.
        I think Guugu Yimithirr kept their ability, because their language reenforces this closed feedback loop

i think guuugu yimithirr closed their feedback loop
existing navigation SS studies did not accurately, but still got results
native SS vs alien SS (=sensory addition)
