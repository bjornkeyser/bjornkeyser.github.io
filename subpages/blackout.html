                The project aimed to develop a tool for generating blackout poetry. This involves selecting words from a text and blacking out the rest until a poem is formed. The challenge was to create a system that could emulate the "human" critic in the process of creating poetry. To achieve this, various techniques such as a recursive decision tree approach, Markov chains, rhyme, and alliteration schemes were implemented to select the most suitable sentences based on their Markov score.  The project was implemented using P5js.​​​​​​​
