    <div class="description">
        For the final Hardware & Physical Computing assignment, we built on recent scientific findings regarding plant sound emissions; we don’t mean the rustle of leaves in the wind and branches cracking under pressure, but inaudible ultrasonic sounds that can be detected from a distance. These sounds are emitted when the plant is under poor conditions such as drought stress. For our project we made these inaudible sounds audible for humans, and observed how hearing the plants in real time affects how people choose to interact with the plants.
