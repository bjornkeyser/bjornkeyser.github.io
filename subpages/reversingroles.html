    <div class="description">
        The project, titled "Reversing Roles", aims to explore the relationship between computers and humans in the context of design through a physical workbook. Traditionally, computers are seen as executors while humans are seen as ideators, but this project explores an approach where those roles are gradually reversed. The workbook consists of activities, exercises, and examples that encourage the reader to think critically about this new relationship and its implications for thinking creatively.
        For the computer system, the project makes use of the OpenAI GPT-3, which is fed with an inspiring set to generate ideas and methods. 
        The output of the project is a physical book that includes prompts for the user to directly make the exercises in the book and experiment with GPT-3 to generate new ideas and methods.
