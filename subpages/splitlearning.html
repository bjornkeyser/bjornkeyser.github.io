    <div class="description">
        Due to the sensitive nature of financial data - e.g. customer data or financial transactions - as well as due to the financial information sector being highly regulated, it is a necessity to keep this data private and unexposed. This becomes a challenge however, when some parties having different data about the same instances, want to collaborate by pooling their data and applying deep learning algorithms on this pooled data. This paper evaluates the performance of various configurations of a recently introduced privacy-aware deep learning technique called split neural network (split NN) on certain financial scenarios which could benefit from using aggregated data, such as fraud detection and insurance claim approval. We show what factors are important when choosing the split network's hyperparameters, and what configurations can have detrimental effects on the split network's performance.
