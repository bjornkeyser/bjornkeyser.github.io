        relationships these days are hybrid, in the sense that they are lived out both irl && digitally.
        <br>
        tho all social interaction is played out onl(i/o)nely, we barely shine light on the textual tension embedded in the (dis)comfort of your pocket.
        <br>
        feel like feeling your chat?
        <br>
        relive your digital convo thru another lens and reflect on the hidden dynamics underlying ur relations.

    Textual Tension allows participants to upload a WhatsApp conversation of their choice, which gets translated to an Audio Visual experience, where the objective for the participant is to distinguish which of the two representations they are. The question I set out to research was <i>does our chat behavior reflect us?</i> We have chosen to embody the conversation as a sphere which both individuals involved feed with their texts. The sphere is grown and at the same time pushed left and right by the words flying in, coming from the representative mouths of the individuals. The position and appearance of the sphere are fully determined by the content and amount of messaging happening between the individuals. For example, if one person texts a lot more than the other, the ball is pushed towards the other person and will lie there until that person texts back. We aimed to thus visualize the “ball being in someone’s court” in an analogous intuitive manner. The used emojis and punctuation are what makes up the sphere and aims to abstract away all informational content and leaves only the expressiveness of emoji use and punctuation as a representation of the contents of the chat. By using this sphere-pushing representation of texting, we embody qualities such as the length of messages and frequency of them intuitively by linking them to an understandable abstraction, where messaging more and more frequently pushes the sphere more and more to the other. If there is an equal amount of back and forth happening, the forces on the sphere cancel each other out, and keep it in the middle of the screen, representing perhaps a “balanced” conversation.
