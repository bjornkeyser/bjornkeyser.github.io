        For this study I looked at how my brain adapts when there is a slight delay in what I hear. I used
        noise-canceling headphones to create a small delay in all incoming audio, and wore these headphones for as long
        as possible each day for five days. The aim was to see how this delay affected my brain's ability to combine
        what I see and hear. I did a task before and after this experiment to measure how well I could tell if sounds
        and images happened at the same time. The results showed that after wearing the headphones, my brain became more
        tolerant of differences in the timing between what it sees and hears. However, my overall sense of timing didn't
        change much, possibly because I could still hear my own voice in real time, which helped keep my sense of timing
        steady. This experiment helped me understand more about how our senses work together, and it could be useful for
        helping people who have trouble with sensory integration, like people with autism or schizophrenia.
