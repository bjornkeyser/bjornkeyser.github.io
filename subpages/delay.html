        This study looked at how the brain adapts when there is a slight delay in what we hear. I used noise-canceling headphones to create a small delay in sounds, and wore these headphones for as long as possible each day for five days. The aim was to see how this delay affected my brain's ability to combine what I see and hear. I did a task before and after this experiment to see how well they could tell if sounds and images happened at the same time. The results showed that after wearing the headphones, my brain became more tolerant of differences in the timing between what they see and hear. However, my overall sense of timing didn't change much, possibly because I could still hear my own voice in real time, which helped keep my sense of timing steady. This study shows that our brain can quickly adapt to changes in the timing of our senses. This finding is important because it helps us understand more about how our senses work together, and it could be useful for helping people who have trouble with sensory integration, like people with autism or schizophrenia.
