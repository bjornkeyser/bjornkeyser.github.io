        (from course "Intro to Compute Shaders" - by Arsiliath) <br>
        Some code experiments with 100k particles simulating slime mold behavior from @arsiliath 's course on bio-inspired compute shaders. Based on the supposed algorithm behind 'physarum polycephalum' pattern formation by use of trails <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/16/2/127/2650/Characteristics-of-Pattern-Formation-and-Evolution?redirectedFrom=fulltext">[Jones 2010]</a>.
        <br>
        Basically, each particle moves and lays a trail behind it, which slowly disperses (think of a trail of smells), and at the same time steers towards where this trail is sensed the strongest. The fun and beauty lies in what complex behavior forms when having hundreds of thousands of these interact at the same time, and then playing around with the parameters to create variation.
