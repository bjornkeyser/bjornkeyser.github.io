        First babysteps in learning how to make numbers dance for me üíÉ using a different programming approach taught in @arsiliath‚Äôs course on #computeshadersüôè <br>
        This algorithm is called a Cyclic Cellular Automata based on Fisch, Gravner and Griffeath (1991). <br>
        For my non technical audience, these are experiments with ways in which each individual pixel runs the exact same code, doing some math involving that pixel‚Äôs neighbors, which collectively can result in unexpected complex behavior. <br>
        TL;DR - nothing was animated, this is all just each pixel executing the same code, changing its color according to some rules regarding that pixel's neighbors.
