        First babysteps in learning how to make numbers dance for me using a different programming approach taught in Arsiliath’s course on Compute Shaders<br>
        This algorithm is called a Cyclic Cellular Automata based on Fisch, Gravner and Griffeath (1991). <br>
        Simply put,these are experiments with ways in which each individual pixel runs the exact same code, doing some math involving that pixel’s neighbors, which collectively can result in unexpected complex behavior. <br>
        TL;DR - nothing was animated, this is all just each pixel executing the same code, changing its color according to some rules regarding that pixel's neighbors.
