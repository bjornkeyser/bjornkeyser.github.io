    <!-- Description -->
    <div class="description">
        For my Sound, Space & Interaction project, I have created a 3D spatial audio game, in which you play hide and seek with an invisible yet audible ghost that is walking around and taunting you. You navigate the game by physically walking around and you try to catch the ghost by listening to the whispers and footsteps and where they seem to emanate from.
