                <h4 class="heading">About This Project</h4>
                <p class="">I'm studying the potential for humans to consciously perceive magnetic fields using
                    <em>sensory substitution</em>. Building on evidence of subconscious brain responses to magnetic
                    fields and the presence of magnetic particles in the human brain, I aim to enhance these signals to
                    enable conscious perception. This research could significantly advance our understanding of human
                    sensory capabilities and neuroplasticity, offering insights into evolution and navigation.</p>

                <h5 class="question">What is the significance of this project?</h5>
                <p class="">This research offers a unique opportunity to&nbsp;<strong
                        class="redactor-inline-converted">leverage&nbsp;<a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity" target="_blank"
                            rel="nofollow noopener">human neuroplasticity</a></strong>&nbsp;and could redefine our
                    understanding of the&nbsp;<strong class="redactor-inline-converted">human sensory
                        world</strong>&nbsp;and our&nbsp;<strong>species' history</strong>. From a practical standpoint,
                    there are many applications for enhancing magnetoreception. For example, this sense would be
                    beneficial for marine and aerial pilots, who often suffer from&nbsp;<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation" target="_blank"
                        rel="nofollow noopener">spatial disorientation</a>. But in general, I think the amazing thing is
                    that it really is present in each one of us, and if we are successful, each of us has the potential
                    to unlock this new, but more accurately,&nbsp;<em
                        class="redactor-inline-converted">ancient</em>&nbsp;sense. It could open doors for a new
                    dimension of spatial awareness; however, like imagining a new color, we cannot even imagine what
                    such a sense would feel like.</p>
                <h5 class="question">What are the goals of the project?</h5>
                <p class="">Subjects will use<strong class="redactor-inline-converted">&nbsp;a sensory substitution
                        device during the training phase</strong>. This wearable device will give the wearer a sense of
                    direction, and by the mantra of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory"
                        target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">neurons that fire together, wire together</a>", we
                    hypothesize that - over time - the brain will&nbsp;<strong class="redactor-inline-converted">rewire
                        itself to strengthen the connections</strong>&nbsp;to our dormant magnetoreception, as it
                    has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFCECc4lknw" target="_blank"
                        rel="nofollow noopener">been proven to do in other similar scenarios</a>.&nbsp;<strong>Before
                        and after this training phase we conduct measurements;</strong>&nbsp;subjects' EEG response will
                    be measured, as well as their ability to guess which magnetic field rotation occurred (<a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg3pza4y2ws" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">in a
                        setting where the effects of rotating on the magnetic field are simulated without actually
                        having to rotate</a>). We hypothesize a significant difference in the response before and after.

                                    <p class="">(MSc. Media Technology student, principal investigator)</p>
                                    <p class="">After completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Vrije
                                        Universiteit Amsterdam, I felt a desire to apply my knowledge to other domains
                                        of science, not restricting myself to computers, as I have always been
                                        interested in the "natural world" as well.</p>
                                    <p class="">During my current Master's degree in Media Technology at Leiden
                                        University (Netherlands), I realized I was very interested in biology and in
                                        particular the brain, with a computational approach. When I stumbled upon the
                                        field of sensory substitution, I got hooked, as someone with an interest in the
                                        brain's adaptability, but no interest in the invasive surgical side of
                                        neuroscience.</p>
                                    <p class="">Due to my horrible sense of direction, I got obsessed with the topic of
                                        human magnetoreception. Realizing sensory substitution might be suited to
                                        relearn this sense, I couldn't help but pursue the idea.</p>
